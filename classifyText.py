#CNN = Convolutional Neural Network

#the arcitecture this lesson follows is as such
    #word embedding model:
        # simple distrubuted representation of words where different words that have a similar meaning also have a similar
        #representation
    #convolutional model:
        # a feature extraction model that learns to extract salient features from documents represented using a word embedding
    #fully-connected model:
        #the intepretation of extracted features in terms of a predicted output

#a kernel is a filter that is used to extract the features from the images
#hyperparameters = parameters whose values control the learning process and determine the values of model parameters that
#a learning algorithm ends up learning
